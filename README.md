🌿 NGO Website – Built with React + Tailwind CSS

Hi! I'm Atharv Puranik, and this is a fully responsive NGO website I built as part of an internship selection process. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and functional site that reflects the mission of a non-profit organization — and I made sure to include everything from landing pages to forms, all coded from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS.



🚀 Project Overview

This website includes:

- ✅ A beautiful **Home page** with a clear intro to the NGO’s mission
- 📝 A working **Volunteer/Intern Registration Form** (front-end only)
- 📃 An **About Us** section to describe the vision and values
- 📱 **Mobile-first responsive design**
- 🎨 Clean and minimal Tailwind styling
- 💡 Structured for scalability and easy backend integration

I focused on clarity, usability, and a layout that recruiters or real users can actually visualize in production.
